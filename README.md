## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories
- Cache filter in local storage and see the same filters applied when refresh the page or clear filters by removing the value from local storage

## My process

### Built with

- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) w/ Composition API
- [Provide/Inject](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html#provide-inject)
- [Composables](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables.html#composables)
- [Vue Transitions](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/transition.html#transition)


### What I learned

The main objective of doing this challenge was to create some **composables**, aiming scalability and prevention of some errors, even if in this case could be kind of a "overkill" and unnecessary.

Also, I wanted to get used to `provide` and `inject` since I never really needed to use them, but they are important features from Vue.
